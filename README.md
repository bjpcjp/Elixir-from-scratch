![logo](pix/logo.png) __Elixir from scratch__

This is a "minimum viable demo" of the Elixir programming language. It mimics the code snippets found in the ["Getting Started" section](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html) of the Elixir website, ported to `Jupyter Notebooks`.

As of this edit, I am using Elixir 1.7.4.

Each notebook follows a corresponding page in the Elixir documentation. They use the excellent [IElixir kernel](https://github.com/pprzetacznik/IElixir) to run the majority of the code, with occasional screenshots of the IEx command line tool where necessary.

This is a working file; expect edits as my knowledge progresses.
